			If you have thinking of spending some extra time while you're up here, there's quite a lot to do in the area.

			<h3>Hiking</h3>
			It's the Adirondacks!  There's so many mountains nearby, go to the top of them!  I've always wanted to hike up Blue Mountain.  And the High
			Peaks	region (near Lake Placid) two hours drive north.  If mountains aren't your thing, there's tons of relatively flat trails all over the park,
			so finding something at your level shouldn't be very difficult.

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>Swimming</h3>
			The Adirondacks are full of some beautiful lakes and ponds.  There's public beaches in just aboutevery town, and if you're not in a town and come
			upon a body of water, feel free to hop in for a dip.  So bring your swimsuits and have them available for any occasion, some of us try to jump
			in the nearest body of water after every long hike!
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>Mountain towns</h3>
			There's so many cute mountain towns nearby &mdash; if walking around town with an ice cream cone and doing shopping is your thing, there's many
			options available.  Most of them are named after lakes: Northville, Old Forge, Blue Mountain Lake, Long Lake, Tupper Lake, Saranac Lake,
			and Lake placid are all cute towns worth exploring.
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>Lake Placid</h3>
			Lake placid is one of our favorite areas and is worth its own mention. It's a two hour drive north from Speculator.  Once there, you can explore
			the site of	2 (TWO!) olympic games, which includes a bobsled run and ski jumps.  You can drive up to the top of Whiteface Mountain.  You can explore
			their cute downtown and olympic museum.  Unfortunely, the Pipe and Book has closed, so you'll have to bring your own pipes and books.
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>Amusement parks</h3>
			There's <a href="http://www.watersafari.com/">Enchanted Forest Water Safari</a> (where the fun never stops) in Old Forge, which is about an hour
			and a half west of Speculator. Of course, there's <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/greatescape">The Great Escape</a> about an hour east in Lake
			George.  Also in Lake George, <a href="http://www.adirondackextreme.com/">Adirondack Extreme Adventure Course</a> looks pretty neat.
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>On the water</h3>
			There's lakes everywhere!  Big ones like Lake George and the Great Sacandaga Lake and little ones like Lake Pleasant and Oxbow Lake.  When there's
			lakes, you can go out on the water.  There's motor boat and jet ski rentals for the big ones, and kayak and canoe rentals in the smaller ones.  A
			few	even have sea planes that you can charter for a ride.
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>Mountain Biking</h3>
			There's downhill mountain biking at Oak Mountain.  Bring your own bike and buy a day pass so you can bring it up on the lift and then show the
			mountain who's boss all day long.  More info <a href="http://oakmountainski.com/home/index.php/mountain/mountainbiking">here</a>.
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
			<h3>Disc Golf</h3>
			Who doesn't love a round of disc golf?  Allegedly there will be a course built this spring at Oak Mountain.  More info on their
			<a href="http://oakmountainski.com/home/index.php/mountain/disc-golf">website</a>.
